# Timer App Assignment

Welcome to the Timer App Assignment! This project is designed to evaluate your skills in React development, focusing on **UI implementation**, **code quality**, **state management**, and **best practices**. The project uses **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Vitest** for testing.

---

## **Objective**
Your task is to improve and enhance an existing Timer App based on the following requirements. The app currently has a partially implemented timer system, and your goal is to address the listed issues and extend its functionality.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend Framework**: React (with Vite for fast development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest (for unit and component testing)
---

## **Commit Messages and Tracking**
- **Commit Often**: After each significant Feature or Change , commit your work.

- **Conventional Commit Standards**: Use commit messages that follow these guidelines:

   - **feat**: for new features (e.g., feat: add stopwatch lap functionality)

   - **fix**: for bug fixes (e.g., fix: resolve snack bar dismiss error)

   - **refactor**: for code refactoring (e.g., refactor: extract modal buttons into reusable component)

   - **Tracking Changes**: Clear, descriptive commit messages are essential for tracking progress and understanding the history of your changes.
